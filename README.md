# Oral Morals Backend NodeJS

Thanks for the template seyiogunjuyigbe.

## Setup

Step 0

- Rick don't push to main anymore lol.

Step 1

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Oral-Morals/backend-nodejs.git`

Step 2

- Install dependencies with `npm i`

Step 3

- Create a .env file in the root directory (same location as the .env.example)
- Configure .env file based off the .env.example file.

## Development

Step 1

- Get the latest updates with `git pull origin main`.

Step 2

- Fix all merge conflicts that may happen.

Step 3 (Skip if you are already working on an existing branch)

- Create a new branch for all new work and editing existing work with `git checkout -b branch-name-here`.
- This git command will create a new branch and simultaneously switch to it.

Step 4

- Make sure you are on the correct branch.
- Start server in development mode with `npm run dev`.
- Work.
- Add all your work to the staging area with `git add .`.
- Commit changes with `git commit -m "short description of work done here"`.
- If you added to your .env file, update the .env-example file as well.

Step 5

- When you are finished working get the latest updates by pulling from origin with `git pull origin main`.
- Fix all merge conflicts that may happen.

Step 6

- Push your code to upstream with `git push origin branch_name`.
- Now you can proceed to github to create a _pull request_ to the _main_ branch.
- Your pull request will be merged once it is verified not to have conflicts.
- _Please do not push directly to the main branch_

## Troubleshooting

- Try `npm i`.

- `git restore file-name`
